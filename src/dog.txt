Golden retrievers are, unsurprisingly enough, great at retrieving!  Members of the gun dog group, they are very motivated to pick up and carry things in their soft mouths. They deliver the item gently, without marking or damaging it.

Very well-mannered and sociable dogs who greet adults, children and other dogs graciously, golden retrievers are generally very steady on the lead. Goldies hate being left on their own for long so be prepared to include them in as much as you can.

Dogs for Good trainer, Clare, is a big fan of goldies: “They’re incredibly loving, kind, and gentle and they form really strong bonds with people – which makes them great assistance dogs for our clients.

“They don’t forget who they’ve given their love to, either – there are golden retrievers I’ve trained and then see years later who still remember me and greet me like a long-lost friend.”

Trainer Clare says: “From a training point of view, they need to be made to feel that everything you’re asking them to do is their idea.
